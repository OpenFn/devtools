# OpenFn/devtools

A set of tools for writing &amp; testing expressions, managing OpenFn projects,
and developing new adaptors (language-packages).

## Up and running

1. Make sure you've got [git](https://git-scm.com/downloads) (maybe GitBash for
   Windows?)
2. And [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) (version 6.11 or greater)
3. Run `git clone git@github.com:OpenFn/devtools.git` for SSH or
   `git clone https://github.com/OpenFn/devtools.git`
4. Run `cd devtools`
5. Run `./install.sh ssh` or `./install.sh https` to install core,
   language-common, and language-http

_Note: If you get a "permission denied" message when running `./install.sh`, try
`run chmod +x ./install.sh ` then retry the install command._

To install specific adaptors, run
`./install.sh ${ssh || https} language-${name}`

You can run core from anywhere by using `npm install -g @openfn/core` for a
global install.

## Usage

Execute takes:

1. `-l [language-package].Adaptor`: The adaptor being used
2. `-e [expression.js]:` The expression being tested
3. `-s [state.json]`: The message `data: {...}` and credential
   `configuration: {...}`
4. `-o [output.json]`: The file to which the output will be written

### Bash usage

`./core/bin/core execute execute -l ./adaptors/language-[XXX].Adaptor -s ./tmp/state.json -o ./tmp/output.json -e ./tmp/expression.js`

### The `--test` option

`./core/bin/core execute -l ./adaptors/language-[XXX].Adaptor -s ./tmp/state.json -o ./tmp/output.json -e ./tmp/expression.js --test`

This intercepts all HTTP requests and displays the request information for
debugging.

#### `.FakeAdaptor`

Adaptors may provide dummy modules for testing. `language-salesforce` has a
built-in `.FakeAdaptor` which allows a user to test expressions on data without
sending them to a real Salesforce server.

Instead of using `-l ./language-salesforce.Adaptor`, use
`-l./language-salesforce.FakeAdaptor` to test expressions offline:
`./core/bin/core execute -l ./language-salesforce.FakeAdaptor -s ./tmp/state.json -o ./tmp/output.json -e ./tmp/expression.js`

#### Offline testing for other `language-packages`

For most standard language packages which make use of HTTP requests, you can add
`--test` to the execute command to intercept all HTTP requests.

## Modifying or developing new adaptors

## Configure an OpenFn project

You can use YAML project configuration files to define projects both on the [OpenFn platform](https://docs.openfn.org/documentation/deploy/platform) and in [OpenFn microservice](https://openfn.github.io/microservice/readme.html#content). Running `./scripts/generate-project.js` helps you build a project config YAML interactively, adding your triggers, credentials and jobs to the config.

If you choose `monolith mode`, all your job code will be included in the YAML. In `URI` mode, youâ€™ll get a config file with URI-s to your defined jobs.

### Pre-Requisites

1. [Make](http://www.gnu.org/software/make/) is used so that our modern (es9)
   JavaScript can be run on older Node runtimes.
2. _wip_
